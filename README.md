### Web Mapping Analysis and Screenshot ###  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This past summer I worked with the City of Surrey to help map online housing posts that were classified using machine learning. My primary job was to create visualizations of the data, but in using ArcGIS/QGIS I was limited to sharing .pdf and .png files which lack the interactivity of a web based map. Thus, I decided to use one of the datasets I created this summer and present it in a way that the end user could interact with the data directly. The primary audience for my map would be urban planners within the City of Surrey, but more broadly this map could be used by potential renters to get a feel for the market.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this map I began with the basic template in mapbox studio. As the data used for this map is limited to Surrey, I decided to remove many of the layers that were only relevant for maps with more widely distributed data. The layers removed for this reason include the labels for, states, POIs, airports and countries. However, I chose to keep the national_park layer as potential renters may want to know if there is a park nearby one of the data points. Removing the unnecessary layers allows the map to be rendered more quickly within the browser and helps the user focus on the data at the intended spatial scale.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For styling, I used a near-black background with streets in light grey and country/state borders in a bold white. To make the labels more readable against the black background, I reversed the text fill and outline stroke colors. The imported data is from a .csv file with a column for category which was one of ‘Entire Property’, ‘Secondary Suite’ and ‘Individual Room’. The respective colors chosen for these layers were orange, green and violet. These color choices simply serve to help focus the user’s attention towards them by contrasting with each other and the background. I initially uploaded the layer as a single file with conditional formatting for each category, but I later chose to upload them individually to allow each layer to be toggled by the user via the layer toggle buttons on the top left of the map. The circle for each of the housing layers begins at a base radius size of 2.75 px beyond 11 zoom and increases in radius size up to 60px at max zoom. The map became too cluttered at the city level when using the road layer’s default properties and was altered to only appear after the user has zoomed in sufficiently. Lastly, the width of the administrative borders decreases as the user zooms in and out. The ordering of the layers was based upon Andy Skinners “Introducing a Human Geography Basemap”.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I believe this map is effective at helping the user understand the distribution of online housing posts available in Surrey, there are many ways in which it could be improved. Each individual point feature could be made into a clickable entity that displays more information about the residence like cost, sqft, and the Craigstlist/VRBO URL. Further, a more representative symbol than a circle could be used to better convey the nature of the data. Lastly, a long term goal would be to create a map that auto-updates as new housing posts are collected.

The following screenshot shows an interesting part of the data, there are almost no individual rooms available in South Surrey compared to the rest of the city:
